We have 95% confidence that the population mean height of 5-year old boys in Glasgow is between 107.79 and 110.05cm, with our best estimate being 108.92cm. Since this CI contains 110cm, there is no significant evidence (at the 5% significance level) that Glaswegian 5-year old boys are shorter than UK average. However, the upper CI is borderline. Overall from these data we can say that whilst Glaswegian children may be the same height on average as children in the rest of the UK, they may be up to 2cm shorter. Remember that we are assuming that the data are an independent representative (or better still random) sample (see next week’s workbook for more about this)!"

Calculate this interval by hand and interpret the result.\nThe critical value is 1.81 instead of 1.96 for a 93% CI.\n108.92 +/- 1.81 * 5.77/√100 (107.78908, 109.96437) \nThe population mean height of 5-year old boys in Glasgow is between 107.88 and 109.96cm with 93% confidence, with our best estimate being 108.92cm. This CI does not contain 110cm, so there is some evidence (at the 7% significance level) that Glaswegian 5-year-old boys are shorter than UK average. However, the upper CI is very close to 110cm, so any height reduction may be very small."

    "text": "Question 2 (iii)\nExplain the difference between them. Why might a 93% confidence interval not be as useful as a 95% one?\n93% CI is narrower than 95% CI as it has a lower confidence of containing the population mean. Whilst 95% is an arbitrary choice, its use helps to ensure consistency across research, so care must be taken using any alternative, especially if it changes the interpretation of the results."

    "text": "Question 3 - LDL at Baseline\nThe sample estimate of baseline, 4.11 mmol/L, is just over 1 mmol/L greater than the upper limit of the normal upper limit of 3 mmol/L. We can say with 95% confidence that baseline LDL in population of renal transplant patients is between 4.05 and 4.18 mmol/L.\nThus renal transplant patients have LDL cholesterol that is on average at least 1 mmol/L higher than the upper limit of the normal range. Due to the large sample size we have a very precise estimate of the population average. These patients are therefore obvious candidates in which to test the effectiveness of statins at reducing LDL and more importantly whether they reduce the rate at which major adverse cardiac events (e.g. stroke or MI) happen. We obviously need to assume that the data are an independent representative sample (the sample can’t be perfectly random)."

However, this is only likely to be true for young adults within each sex. What we have is a mixture of 2 Normal distributions for weight (and height). If we consider males and females separately, they should both look normal. Also note that tests for normality should be treated with caution, as in small samples they lack power to detect data from non-normal distributions and in large samples they can give significant results when the deviations are irrelevantly small."
