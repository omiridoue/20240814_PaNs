## Aim

-   Introduce features of a Quarto presentation and demonstrate ways you can adapt this template for a presentation or any talk that relies on R for output.

>   Adding a right pointing arrow allows you to indent text \

>   If you want to start a new line of text add a backward slash at the end of a line \

>    **You can make text bold by adding two asterisks on either end of a phrase**
    
>    [Add Hyperlink Text](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs)

## Learning Outcomes

-   To make a list start the code line with a dash then TAB and end line;
-   Perhaps you would like to take stock of your previous talks/workshops in one place;

## Making your Slides FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

-   To do this navigate to your GitHub page and create your first repository;
    - Name this yourGitHubusername.github.io;
-   There are many ways to host your render Quarto into html, we will do this locally and deploy our page to GitHub through the \docs branch option.
-   
-   Your slides will then be public and findable under https://yourGitHubusername.github.io/NameofRepository
-   Note if you have a GitHub education page you don't need to make the repo

## There are different extensions this one is called quiz-question {.quiz-question}

- Write Option here
- Write Option here
- [THIS WILL BE YOUR CORRECT ANSWER]{.correct}
- WRITE Option here

## Save all your images in your images folder. 

Once you open your R project you will be able to load images through the relative
path images/

## Making your Analysis Reproducible


> `Anything you wrap inside these back ticks will appear like so normally you can do this for technical parts`

- `You can input highlighted text in line` for example `Ctrl+R`.

##  Code Chunk Explained a Bit More

The code chunks will include all your code, you can click Insert a new code chunk to your top right.
Each chunk should have its own name. You can add a name after the first reserved word which
refers to the language your code is in, this will be lowercase r for any R code. Follow the chunk name by
a comma, for names try avoiding dashes, if there is an error with your code the error message will
let you know which chunk has an issue. To evaluate, run the code, you will need to type `eval = TRUE`,
if you do not want to run this code when you render the document change to `FALSE`. If you want to 
print your code in the slides add `echo = TRUE`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}     

library(network)
```


## Quarto allows you to have different tabs

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### (a) Low 
```{r echo=TRUE}
low_prevalence <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 10, prob = 0.1)    # provide your own parameters
length(low_prevalence) 
head(low_prevalence)
```

#### (b) Moderate
```{r echo=TRUE}
moderate_prevalence <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 10, prob = 0.4)    # provide your own parameters
length(moderate_prevalence) 
head(moderate_prevalence)
```

#### (c) High
```{r echo=TRUE}
high_prevalence <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 10, prob = 0.6)     # provide your own parameters
length(high_prevalence) 
head(high_prevalence)
```
::: 

## Summary for Results

```{r echo=TRUE}

library(psych)
library(knitr)

summary_samples <- rbind(low_smoking = describe(low_prevalence,quant=c(.25,.75) ), 
                         moderate_smoking = describe(moderate_prevalence,quant=c(.25,.75) ), 
                         high_smoking = describe(high_prevalence,quant=c(.25,.75)) )

summary_samples <- summary_samples[,c("mean","se", "sd", "min", "Q0.25", "median", "Q0.75", "max")]

kable(summary_samples)

```

You can wrap LaTeX code in $x$, for any symbols.
You can dynamically refer to a variable output in line, like the standard deviation `{r} round(sd(low_prevalence),2)`

Or the value of the median to describe your data  `{r} median(low_prevalence)`


## You can Section a Slide into Different Columns

>**Maybe you want to Summarise Your Ideas **

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
**Idea 1**

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

## Code Animations {auto-animate="true"}

-   Over 20 syntax highlighting themes available
-   Default theme optimized for accessibility

``` r
# Define a server for the Shiny app
function(input, output) {
  
  # Fill in the spot we created for a plot
  output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
    # Render a barplot
    barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
            main=input$region,
            ylab="Number of Telephones",
            xlab="Year")
  })
}
```

## Line Highlighting

-   Highlight specific lines for emphasis
-   Incrementally highlight additional lines

``` {.python code-line-numbers="4-5|7|10"}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Easy Navigation

Quickly jump to other parts of your presentation

Toggle the slide menu with the menu button (bottom left of slide) to go to other slides and access presentation tools.


You can also press `m` to toggle the menu open and closed.

:::

## Chalkboard {chalkboard-buttons="true"}

Free form drawing and slide annotations


Use the chalkboard button at the bottom left of the slide to toggle the chalkboard.

Use the notes canvas button at the bottom left of the slide to toggle drawing on top of the current slide.


You can also press `b` to toggle the chalkboard or `c` to toggle the notes canvas.
