## Making your Slides FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) 

**Step 1** create a new repository on your GitHub name this yourGitHubusername.github.io <br>
**Step 2** Add a ReadMe file and type Hello World! This will be your home page if you do not already have one. Any time you work on a new repository and publish this it will 
be a sub-directory of the page. <br>
**Step 3** Clone the repository from the following link <https://omiridoue.github.io/20240814_PaNs> <br>
**Step 4** There are many ways to host the presentation you are about to render through Quarto. We will render this locally and tell Quarto to output all files in html format to the docs subfolder. We will then tell GitHub to look for these files and deploy our html slides. <br>

## Continued - Follow Along Today's Material
**Step 5** Create a repository on your GitHub and name this 20240814_PaNs <br>
**Step 6** Follow the steps from <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories> to sync your local and remote repositories, make sure to push all this content to your remote repository. The aim by the end of this session is to make your slides public and findable under the following URL **https://yourGitHubusername.github.io/20240814_PaNs**. Note if you have a GitHub Education page you don't need to make the repository public, but your slides and homepage will be public.

## Continued - Follow Along Today's Material

**Step 7** This is the last part of setting up. We need to navigate to the settings of our new repository and click through these steps.

## Intended Outcomes

1. Render the template locally
    i) Sync your local to your remote repository
    ii) Deploy your slides from your `/docs` branch
2. Begin to tinker with the template
3. Understand the folder structure of the template
4. Understand what different components within Quarto do
5. Understand how to modify the settings configured within Quarto
    i) yaml 
    ii) style sheets 
    iii) renv

# Getting Started with Quarto { background-color="#038AAD"}

## Quarto recognises ## as a command to make a new slide

Customise these headings by tinkering with the styles.css file. Maybe we can come up with a
Quarto template for SPHSU branding? To tinker with the fonts/colors go to the styles.css document
and navigate to the different heading definitions. 

### Heading 3 - three #'s
#### Heading 4 - four #'s
##### Heading 5 - five #'s
###### Heading 6 - six #'s
 
## Features in your Text
If you want to start a new line of text add a `<br>` at the end <br> 
of a line <br>

**You can make text bold by adding two asterisks on either end of a phrase**
    
[Add Text to Your Hyperlink](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs)

Anything you wrap inside these back ticks will appear as highlighted text in line for example `Ctrl+R`.

<br> 

> To draw your attention here I've added a `>`. This page has nothing to do with `narwhals` but is related to Networks-
<https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/>

## Intermission - What is one unique characteristic of the narwhal that makes it easily distinguishable from other sea creatures? {.quiz-question}

- Its unusual pink colour
- The fringe of "hair"
- [Its tusk]{.correct}
- Its square head

## Read in Figures from your /images folder 

Once you open your R project you will be able to load images through the relative
path images/

![Add an image caption here](images/MRC_CSO_SPHSU_Glasgow_RGB_0.png)

##  What are Code Chunks?

Code chunks will include all your code, you can click Insert a new code chunk to your top right. Each chunk should have its own name. You can add a name after the first reserved word which refers to the language your code is interpreted with, this will be lowercase `r` for any R code. Follow the chunk name by a comma. To name chunks try avoid using dashes, if there is an error with your code the error message will let you know which chunk you might want to look for to fix this. For R to recognise that you want it to run the code in your chunk, you will need to type `eval = TRUE`. If you do not want to run this code each time you render the document change to `eval = FALSE`. If you want to print your code in the slides add `echo = TRUE`. There are a couple of more options you might want to check like `warnings` or `message` to suppress any messages. For the following chunk we specify `{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, output=TRUE}     

require(network)
```

## Easy Navigation

Quickly jump to other parts of your presentation

Toggle the slide menu with the menu button (bottom left of slide) to go to other slides and access presentation tools.


You can also press `m` to toggle the menu open and closed.

## Chalkboard {chalkboard-buttons="true"}

Free form drawing and slide annotations


Use the chalkboard button at the bottom left of the slide to toggle the chalkboard.

Use the notes canvas button at the bottom left of the slide to toggle drawing on top of the current slide.


You can also press `b` to toggle the chalkboard or `c` to toggle the notes canvas.

## Literature

### Citations

Citations follow the standard
[Quarto format](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#citations)
and be sourced from BibLaTex, BibTeX, or CLS files. You will need to navigate to the bibliography section of your yaml at
the top of this document to specify the name of the file that contains all yuor reference information.
For example:

 - Diffusion of Innovations [@rogers_diffusion_1983; @kermack_contributions_1939; @valente_social_1996]
 
 - Teenage Glasgow Friendship Network [@michell_girls_1997; @bush_1997; @michell_pressure_1997; @michell_perceptions_1997; @michell_1996; @pearson_2000; @pearson_2006; @steglich_2010; @pearson_2006a; @veenstra_2012]
 

## Data

```{r prepare_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

lapply(list('dplyr', 'reshape2', 'igraph', "sigmajs"), library, character.only = TRUE)
source("code/00_prepare_data.R")
```

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### (a) Friendship Network
Click anywhere on this pane to wake up the plot.
```{r graph1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output=TRUE}
sigmajs() %>%
      sg_from_igraph(g1) %>% 
      sg_neighbours() %>% 
      sg_settings(drawLabels = TRUE, 
                  hoverFontStyle = "bold", 
                  labelColor = "node", 
                  labelSizeRatio = 3,
                  defaultLabelHoverColor = "node",
                  mouseWheelEnabled = TRUE, 
                  drawEdgeLabels = FALSE,
                  labelThreshold= 100) %>% 
      sg_drag_nodes() %>% 
      sg_layout() %>%
      sg_noverlap()

```

#### (b) Descriptive Measures
```{r graph2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output=TRUE}
library(htmlTable)
source("code/01_descriptive_statistics.R")
styled_table1

```
::: 

## Methods

:::{.callout-note} 

### Explain your model {#eq-stddev}

$$
P_{\theta,\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{Y=y|X})=\frac{exp\{\theta^{\textsf{T}}g(y,X)\}}{\kappa(\theta,\mathcal{Y})}
$$ {#eq-stddev}

:::

Every time you refer to your equation use the tag `(@referencetoequation)` to refer to your equation like so (@eq-stddev).

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r table1,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

styled_table

```

You can wrap LaTeX code in line, to do this use a single dollar sign on either end of your code for example no self-nominations were allowed in the Teenage Glasgow Friendship Data, this means 0 values along our diagonal $A_{ii}=0$.
You can also dynamically refer to a variable output in line, simply use back-ticks around your in line code in this case R. The reciprocity for wave 3 friendships is `{r} round(reciprocity(g3),2)`, if we round it. Next we'll use (@eq-stddev) to explain present our methods.

## Methods {#sec-crossref}

```{r run_ergm, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(ergm)
friendship_network <- as.network(friendships_t1)

Model_1 <- ergm(friendship_network ~ edges)

Model_01_GOF <- gof(Model_1, 
                    GOF = ~idegree + odegree + espartners + distance, 
                        verbose = TRUE, 
                        control = control.gof.ergm(seed = 12345))
```


``` {r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| code-line-numbers: "4|6|7-9"

library(ergm)
friendship_network <- as.network(friendships_t1)

Model_1 <- ergm(friendship_network ~ edges)

Model_01_GOF <- gof(Model_1, 
                    GOF = ~idegree + odegree + espartners + distance, 
                        verbose = TRUE, 
                        control = control.gof.ergm(seed = 12345))
```

-   Highlight specific lines for emphasis
-   Incrementally highlight additional lines

To cross-reference your model fit, you have several options, for example:

- This will take you to your [[Appendix]{.button}](#sec-appendix)
- Quarto's native cross-reference label would be "See @sec-appendix."
