	abstract = {Social network analysis is used widely in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering. The social network perspective focuses on relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research, which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field.},

	abstract = {Threshold models have been postulated as one explanation for the success or failure of collective action and the diffusion of innovations. The present paper creates a social network threshold model of the diffusion of innovations based on the Ryan and Gross (1943) adopter categories: (1) early adopters; (2) early majority; (3) late majority; (4) laggards. This new model uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization, instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used previously. The present paper argues that these four adopter categories can be created either with respect to the entire social system, or with respect to an individual's personal network. This dual typology is used to analyze three diffusion datasets to show how external influence and opinion leadership channel the diffusion of innovations. Network thresholds can be used (1) to vary the definition of behavioral contagion, (2) to predict the pattern of diffusion of innovations, and (3) to identify opinion leaders and followers in order to understand the two-step flow hypothesis better.},

	abstract = {In a recently published paper (Kermack \& McKendrick, 1937) the observational data relating to epidemics of ectromelia in populations of mice maintained under experimental conditions (Greenwood et al. 1936) has been analysed in the light of a mathematical theory of epidemics developed by us during recent years (Kermack \& McKendrick, 1927, 1932, 1933, 1936). It was shown that the life table giving the chance of mice surviving for various lengths of time in infected communities is very closely represented by a formula calculated on the assumption that the various rates—infection rate, recovery rate, death rate, etc.—are constants. It is, of course, realized that this simplifying assumption can only be regarded as approximately true. It renders the application of the general theory practicable, and the result of the investigation justifies its use, in so far as the theory so simplified does actually conform to the experimental results.},
