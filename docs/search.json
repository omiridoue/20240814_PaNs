This will be your home page if you do not already have one. Any time you work on a new repository and publish this it will be a sub-directory of the page.  Step 3 Clone the repository from the following link https://omiridoue.github.io/20240814_PaNs  Step 4 There are many ways to host the presentation you are about to render through Quarto. We will render this locally and tell Quarto to output all files in html format to the docs subfolder. We will then tell GitHub to look for these files and deploy our html slides."

To name chunks try avoid using dashes, if there is an error with your code the error message will let you know which chunk you might want to look for to fix this. For R to recognise that you want it to run the code in your chunk, you will need to type eval = TRUE. If you do not want to run this code each time you render the document change to eval = FALSE. If you want to print your code in the slides add echo = TRUE. There are a couple of more options you might want to check like warnings or message to suppress any messages. For the following chunk we specify {r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}.\n\nrequire(network)"
